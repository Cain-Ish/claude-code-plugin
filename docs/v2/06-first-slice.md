# v2 first slice: the walking skeleton

**Status:** draft, from the locked set in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) and the architecture in
[04-architecture.md](04-architecture.md). It is built after the concept phase's gate, and measured by the eval in
[05-eval-plan.md](05-eval-plan.md).

## Order (PM1: outcome before input)

0. **Two probes the phase gate found missing. Done 2026-10-22:** `clear` and `resume` arrive (3 of 3 each); the
   read hook does not reach subagents, so the labels hold for main-session reads only. Neither needed v2 code.
   - D12's nonce probe for `SessionStart` on `clear` and `resume` (3 runs each). The matcher then includes every
     source that arrives.
   - A plugin `PostToolUse` hook on a Read made inside an Explore and a general-purpose subagent: what reaches the
     subagent, and what reaches the main session. Until it passes, the labels are claimed for main-session reads only.
1. **The eval harness, re-baselined on Opus 5.5** (05-eval-plan.md, the last section). It needs no v2 code: it is
   D17's and D20's harnesses, plus answer assertions for D22's six investigation tasks. The thresholds are set from
   these runs, by D17's rule and its gap targets, before any v2 code is written.
2. **The skeleton** below. Nothing else.
3. **The v2 arm** on A1 and A2, against those thresholds. A release cites this run (PM1).

## What the skeleton is

| Surface | What it does | Outcome it serves (PM6) | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` hook (startup, compact), shell form once, then Node | the capture instruction; the document index | Capture; Consistency | D14, D22, D18 |
| `UserPromptSubmit` hook | the forced decision, at the first prompt and the first after each compaction | Consistency | D22 |
| `PostToolUse` hook after a Read of a `.project-map/` file | the unreviewed label (D14) and the re-find label (D16) on the entries just read | Freshness; trust (PM5) | D14, D16, D18 |
| onboarding command | builds the index from git's file list; checks Node and git | Onboarding | D15, D18 |

Not in the skeleton:
- D20's write-time net (deferred until a check source catches pattern rules);
- `SubagentStart`;
- any model call;
- MCP, agents and skills.

## Budget (PM8: units that cost)

| Unit | Budget | Grounded in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Always-on bytes per session | 904 B plus the index; an index past 6 KB (P2's size) is measured before it ships | D13 re-locked, D22 |
| Bytes per forced decision | 227 B, at most once per epoch (the session's start, then after each compaction) | D22 |
| Added hook p95 at 8 concurrent sessions, Windows | at most 100 ms per hook; the index build from git's file list at session start is measured first (unmeasured so far) | D18 |
| Processes per hook event | 1 Node process; hooks spawn only `git` | D18 |
| Product lines (hooks, library, command; not tests or the harness) | at most 600 | D18's runtime prototype: 331 lines covering the guards, cache and labels |
| Surfaces | 3 hook events, 1 command, 0 agents, 0 MCP servers, 0 skills | D18, PM6 |

## Done means

- The v2 arm meets the thresholds on A1 and A2 as `05-eval-plan.md` sets them, per cell:
  - a gain where it sets a gain, cost cells included;
  - no worse only on the cells whose spread is at least their median.

  The exceptions are the expected misses in its one list. A miss elsewhere is recorded against the trigger it fires
  (for cost, D22's).
- Every hook is measured on Windows under 8 concurrent sessions against its budget (PM3).
- The map stays readable and correctable with the plugin off: delete the cache, rebuild it, and the eval scores the
  same (PM4).
