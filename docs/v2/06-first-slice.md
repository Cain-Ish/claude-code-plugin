# v2 first slice: the walking skeleton

**Status:** draft, from the locked set in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) and the architecture in
[04-architecture.md](04-architecture.md). It is built after the concept phase's gate, and measured by the eval in
[05-eval-plan.md](05-eval-plan.md).

## Order (PM1: outcome before input)

0. **Two probes the phase gate found missing. Done 2026-10-22:** `clear` and `resume` arrive (3 of 3 each); the
   read hook does not reach subagents, so the labels hold for main-session reads only. Neither needed v2 code.
   - D12's nonce probe for `SessionStart` on `clear` and `resume` (3 runs each). The matcher then includes every
     source that arrives.
   - A plugin `PostToolUse` hook on a Read made inside an Explore and a general-purpose subagent: what reaches the
     subagent, and what reaches the main session. Until it passes, the labels are claimed for main-session reads only.
1. **The eval harness, re-baselined on Opus 5.5** (05-eval-plan.md, the last section). It needs no v2 code: it is
   D17's and D20's harnesses, plus answer assertions for D22's six investigation tasks. The thresholds are set from
   these runs, by D17's rule and its gap targets, before any v2 code is written.
2. **The skeleton** below. Nothing else.
3. **The v2 arm** on A1 and A2, against those thresholds. A release cites this run (PM1).

## What the skeleton is

| Surface | What it does | Outcome it serves (PM6) | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` hook (startup, clear, resume, compact: D12 step 0), shell form once, then Node | the capture instruction; the document index | Capture; Consistency | D14, D22, D18 |
| `UserPromptSubmit` hook | the forced decision, at the first prompt and the first after each compaction | Consistency | D22 |
| `PostToolUse` hook after a Read of a `.project-map/` file | the unreviewed label (D14) and the re-find label (D16) on the entries just read | Freshness; trust (PM5) | D14, D16, D18 |
| onboarding command | builds the index from git's file list; checks Node and git | Onboarding | D15, D18 |

Not in the skeleton:
- D20's write-time net (deferred until a check source catches pattern rules);
- `SubagentStart`;
- any model call;
- MCP, agents and skills.

## Budget (PM8: units that cost)

| Unit | Budget | Grounded in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Always-on bytes per session | 904 B plus the index; an index past 6 KB (P2's size) is measured before it ships | D13 re-locked, D22 |
| Bytes per forced decision | 227 B, at most once per epoch (the session's start, then after each compaction) | D22 |
| Added hook p95 at 8 concurrent sessions, Windows | at most 100 ms per hook; the index build from git's file list at session start is measured first (unmeasured so far) | D18 |
| Processes per hook event | 1 Node process; hooks spawn only `git` | D18 |
| Product lines (hooks, library, command; not tests or the harness) | at most 600 | D18's runtime prototype: 331 lines covering the guards, cache and labels |
| Surfaces | 3 hook events, 1 command, 0 agents, 0 MCP servers, 0 skills | D18, PM6 |

## Done means

- The v2 arm meets the thresholds on A1 and A2 as `05-eval-plan.md` sets them, per cell:
  - a gain where it sets a gain, cost cells included;
  - no worse only on the cells whose spread is at least their median.

  The exceptions are the expected misses in its one list. A miss elsewhere is recorded against the trigger it fires
  (for cost, D22's).
- Every hook is measured on Windows under 8 concurrent sessions against its budget (PM3).
- The map stays readable and correctable with the plugin off: delete the cache, rebuild it, and the eval scores the
  same (PM4).

## Step 2 in four commits (2026-10-25)

2a, the skeleton; 2b, the harnesses' v2 arm, loading the plugin with `--plugin-dir` as a user would; 2c, the v2 arm
on A1; 2d, on A2. The expected-miss list is registered in 2c, before any v2 run.

### 2a: the skeleton's check (pre-registered 2026-10-25, before any code)

- **What is built:** `plugin/`, holding `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`, a library and one entry
  script under `scripts/`, and `commands/onboard.md`. No marketplace file until a release.
- **Surfaces:** exactly 3 hook events, 1 command, 0 agents, 0 MCP servers, 0 skills:
  - `SessionStart` on `startup`, `clear`, `resume` and `compact`;
  - `UserPromptSubmit`;
  - `PostToolUse` matched on `Read`.
- **Product lines:** at most 600 non-blank lines under `plugin/`, tests and the bench excluded. Counted in the commit.
- **Texts, verbatim, asserted by the self-test:**
  - D14's capture instruction (904 B, sha256 `8aa72396af72`);
  - D22's index first line;
  - D22's forced decision (227 B);
  - D14's label `unreviewed, not yet committed` and D16's `unverified quote, captured <date>`;
  - D18's missing-Node message, from its shell-form wrapper.
- **Behaviour, by an assert-based self-test in a temporary git repo:**
  - *The index:* tracked document files (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.txt`, `.rst`, any case), grouped by directory,
    plus untracked files under `.project-map/`. Untracked documents elsewhere and non-documents are left out.
  - *The forced decision:* emitted once per epoch. Every `SessionStart` source starts an epoch, held as a marker file
    in the OS temp folder keyed by the session id; nothing is written in the repo.
  - *The read labels:* on a Read of a `.project-map/` file, an entry its `HEAD` version holds gets no D14 label, one it
    does not hold gets it, and outside git every entry gets it. A Read of any other file exits with no output.
- **Smoke:** pinned CLI 2.1.305, `--plugin-dir`, Haiku, not counted. One session in a temporary repo with one
  document and a `.project-map/captured.md` holding one committed and one uncommitted entry. It must quote:
  - the index's first sentence;
  - the forced text;
  - after it Reads the map file, the labels the hook added.

  This also settles whether exec form with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` inside `args` works in a plugin's `hooks.json`.
  If it does not, attempt 2 is a shell-form string.
- **Load:** on Windows, on a worktree of P2 at its pinned commit (189 documents, the largest index), 200 calls per
  hook at 1 and 8 concurrent, against an empty Node process. The four calls measured are session start, the prompt
  hook, a Read of a non-map file (the frequent fast exit), and a Read of a map file.
  - *Pass:* each hook's added p95 at 8 concurrent is at most 100 ms (D18).
- **The cache, decided by that number:**
  - If session start passes with the index built from `git ls-files` every time, `.project-map/.cache/` is not built,
    and 04's row is corrected with the number.
  - If it fails, a cache is attempt 2.
- **Out of scope:**
  - *D16's re-find.* Under the frozen capture instruction no captured entry carries a `verified` line, so every entry
    is unverifiable, and the re-find would never run. D16's trigger "unverifiable entries exceed 5% of a repo" fires
    by construction. The smoke records it, and D16 is the next decision after 2a. The skeleton labels such entries as
    unverified with their date, the rule D16 sets for them, so none is delivered as current.
  - D20's net, the harness arm (2b), and the v2 runs (2c, 2d).
