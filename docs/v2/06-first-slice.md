# v2 first slice: the walking skeleton

**Status:** draft, from the locked set in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) and the architecture in
[04-architecture.md](04-architecture.md). It is built after the concept phase's gate, and measured by the eval in
[05-eval-plan.md](05-eval-plan.md).

## Order (PM1: outcome before input)

1. **The eval harness, re-baselined on Opus 5.5** (05-eval-plan.md, the last section). It needs no v2 code: it is
   D17's and D20's harnesses, plus answer assertions for D22's six investigation tasks. The thresholds are set from
   these runs, by D17's rule and its gap targets, before any v2 code is written.
2. **The skeleton** below. Nothing else.
3. **The v2 arm** on A1 and A2, against those thresholds. A release cites this run (PM1).

## What the skeleton is

| Surface | What it does | Outcome it serves (PM6) | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` hook (startup, compact), shell form once, then Node | the capture instruction; the document index | Capture; Consistency | D14, D22, D18 |
| `UserPromptSubmit` hook | the forced decision, at the first prompt and the first after each compaction | Consistency | D22 |
| `PostToolUse` hook after a Read of a `.project-map/` file | the unreviewed label (D14) and the re-find label (D16) on the entries just read | Freshness; trust (PM5) | D14, D16, D18 |
| onboarding command | builds the index from git's file list; checks Node and git | Onboarding | D15, D18 |

Not in the skeleton:
- D20's write-time net (deferred until a check source catches pattern rules);
- `SubagentStart`;
- any model call;
- MCP, agents and skills.

## Budget (PM8: units that cost)

| Unit | Budget | Grounded in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Always-on bytes per session | 904 B plus the index; an index past 6 KB (P2's size) is measured before it ships | D13 re-locked, D22 |
| Bytes per forced decision | 227 B, at most once per epoch (the session's start, then after each compaction) | D22 |
| Added hook p95 at 8 concurrent sessions, Windows | at most 100 ms per hook | D18 |
| Processes per hook event | 1 Node process; hooks spawn only `git` | D18 |
| Product lines (hooks, library, command; not tests or the harness) | at most 600 | D18's runtime prototype: 331 lines covering the guards, cache and labels |
| Surfaces | 3 hook events, 1 command, 0 agents, 0 MCP servers, 0 skills | D18, PM6 |

## Done means

- The v2 arm meets the thresholds on A1 and A2, cost included (D17's no-worse ceiling), or the miss is recorded
  against the trigger it fires: D22's cost trigger, or the expected miss for P1 R2.
- Every hook is measured on Windows under 8 concurrent sessions against its budget (PM3).
- The map stays readable and correctable with the plugin off: delete the cache, rebuild it, and the eval scores the
  same (PM4).
